# Interactive team slider

## What is the code about?
This is a mini part of a project where I had to create an interacive team members slider for a client.
This is the interactive JS part of the project.

## The end result
The final result is a page that uses JS objects of team members (converted from a database) and dynamically creates a button for each team member.  On clicking each button, basic employee info slides onto the screen for each team member.

## Languages
Purely Javascript is used for this part of the project.
The JS objects used here are example objects.

NOTE: For students of code:
This would be the front end of a bigger project written using a back end language that would save the team members as objects in a database such as PHP (Wordpress, Laravel), Python (Django) or C# (.NET) or any other back end language and platform combination.
(See my other repositories for converting PHP objects to JS objects in Wordpress)
